Dynamic typing              vs.               Static typing
1.It checks during runtime             -- It checks during compile time

2.e.g: javascript,python language      -- e.g: c,c++,java langauage

3.It compile even if they              --  It will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed.

prevent the script from 
running properly .It shows 
error at last

4.// javascript example         -- // c example
 num = 5                              int num;
 console.log(num)                     num = 5;    
                                   
5.It expects its variables  --  determines its variables' data types based on their values, 
they can be assigned values      so this line is not required.

2.***********Programming********           Vs  *************Scripting ************************
1.A programming language is a    -- A scripting language is a kind of programming language 
type of computer language           that is used to automate the execution of operations in a runtime environment.
that consists of a set of 
instructions for communicating 
with computers. 


2.designed to make full-fledged   -- assist programming languages and make coding easier and faster. They are typically
software development easier          used for open projects and web development.


3. self-executable                -- requires a host

4.All programming languages       -- All scripting languages are programming languages
are not scripting languages

5.Examples include C, C++,        -- Examples include Perl, PHP, JavaScript, etc.
Java, Python, etc.


3.Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Speed -->  HTTP2 is much faster than HTTP2 
[HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.]

Security --> HTTP2 is more securable than HTTP1.1(customer faced big security risk) as it uses binary protocol instead of using plaintext.


4.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
  *Objects in javascript is somewhat different to other language objects
  *Objects is variables e.g let person = "John Doe";
  *A JavaScript object is a collection of named values having state and behavior (properties and method).e.g:car
  *All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car. All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.
